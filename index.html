                <h3>Seattle</h3>
                <p>Seattle, located on the West Coast in Washington State, is considered the largest city in the Pacific Northwest. As of July 2023, the estimated population of Seattle is 755,078 (U.S. Census Bureau), with a rich diversity of ethnic groups and a vibrant LGBTQ community.

                <h3>Austin</h3>
                <p>Austin, not only the capital of Texas but also known as the Live Music Capital of the World, provides a unique and charming music scene. Jay Brakefield, author of <a href="https://www.texasalmanac.com/articles/texas-music-its-roots-its-evolution#:~:text=Texas%20is%20the%20birthplace%20of,polkas%20and%20other%20European%20forms." target="_blank">Texas Music: Its Roots, Its Evolution</a>, pointed out that the "outlaw country" movement of the 1970s — a fusion of country and rock music rebelling against the Nashville sound — flourished in Austin. Beyond country music, Austin’s musical heritage also incorporates rock, blues, soul, folk, electronic and dance music, making it a melting pot of styles.</p>
                <h3>Chicago</h3>

By sitting back on a boat ride along the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of the city's rich history. And don't forget to bring a jacket when visiting the "Windy City" — the breeze can be chilly!</p>
